    new Chapter(0, `Prelude to the Stormlight Archive`, `Kalak, one of the ten Heralds, wanders through a torn landscape littered with dead humans, thunderclasts, and other beasts. He is traveling to the Heralds' preordained meeting place (a rocky spire) for those who survived the Desolation. Upon arrival, he finds only their leader, Jezrien, waiting for him. At first, Kalak assumes that the other eight must have died, for the battle was "furious". However, he notices seven Honorblades driven point-first into the ground at the base of the spire. Jezrien then informs Kalak that the other Heralds have departed, abandoning the Oathpact. Kalak then admits to Jezrien that he can't return to "the place of nightmares", the waiting place of the Heralds between Desolations. Jezrien then tells Kalak to relinquish his blade as well, for "...it is time for the Oathpact to end." This effectively leaves Talenel (Taln), the only Herald who died in the battle, alone to uphold the Oathpact and the sole sufferer of the pain and torture in the waiting realm. Kalak shows horror and disgust that both Jezrien and himself have been broken by the cycle of Desolations and that they are too weak to face their suffering. They plan to lie and tell the people that they finally won against the "enemy", saying it might even turn out to be true. Their abandonment of mankind is somewhat diluted by the fact that Ishar, another Herald, believes that "...so long as there is one of us still bound to the Oathpact (Talenel), it may be enough. There is a chance we might end the cycle of Desolations." Jezrien points out that mankind also has the Radiants. Finally, both Jezrien and Kalak summon their Blades and slam them into the ground, along with the other seven. They depart in opposite directions along the barren landscape, vowing to go their own ways and to not seek one another or any of the other Heralds. As Kalak is leaving the ring of swords, he looks back and notices a single open spot, "The place where the tenth sword should have gone." Kalak feels deep sorrow and shame for Taln's exclusion, thinking to himself, "Forgive us..." as he walks away.`, 5000, 'Kalak'),
    new Chapter(0.5, `Prologue: To Kill`, `4500 years later, Szeth, a Truthless Shin assassin, waits quietly in a large room, watching the Alethi celebrate the signing of a peace treaty with the Parshendi. He leaves the room, noting that his Parshendi masters will soon withdraw. Szeth wears white under the orders of the Parshendi to follow their traditions so that King Gavilar could see him coming.When he reaches the area just outside the King's quarters, Szeth uses his abilities as a Surgebinder to fight his way past the guards. As he reaches the king's quarters, he is confronted by a Shardbearer as the King flees. Szeth fights his way past the Shardbearer but soon realizes that the Shardbearer, not the man he is chasing, is King Gavilar. He returns and fights him, eventually defeating him by causing the balcony he is standing on to collapse, mortally wounding him. Szeth is nearly killed in the fight. When Szeth tells Gavilar the Parshendi sent him, Gavilar is confused and says, "The Parshendi? That makes no sense." Gavilar then gives Szeth a strange black sphere and tells him, "You must take this. They must not get it." He then instructs Szeth to tell Gavilar's brother Dalinar that he must "find the most important words a man can say." As a Shin, Szeth considers a dying wish to be sacred, so he leaves a note for Dalinar written in Gavilar's blood. He takes the sphere and flees.`, 4500, 'Szeth'),
    new Chapter(1, `Stormblessed`, `Cenn, a new recruit in Brightlord Meridas Amaram's army, is terrified. He is about to face his first battle and has no real idea of what to expect. Cenn is pulled into a new squad, that of Kaladin Stormblessed, at the last minute for reasons he doesn't understand. Dallet, a sergeant, picks Cenn up and returns him to the squad. They are soon joined by Kaladin, who asks Dallet to take care of Cenn during the battle as he won't know the group's signals. They then fall to discussing tactics. The opposing force arrives and the battle begins. Kaladin's squad does not lose a single man. At one point, Kaladin singlehandedly fights off six enemy spearmen to save Cenn. When an enemy Brightlord appears, Kaladin and his squad attempt to defeat him. They are hindered, however, by the arrival of an enemy Shardbearer. Cenn blacks out from blood loss, and the scene cuts out.`, 6000, 'Cenn'),
    new Chapter(2, `Honor is Dead`, `Eight Months Later. Kaladin is now a slave in a caravan, waiting to be sold and struggling to retain his ability to not think like a slave. When approached by another slave about escaping, Kaladin gruffly tells him that he has no plans to escape because it will never work. A second slave approaches Kaladin and asks how he came to be a slave. When Kaladin doesn't respond, the other men tell their stories. It eventually comes out that Kaladin killed a man, but the one he did not kill is the reason he's a slave. Kaladin idly toys with a leaf of blackbane, contemplating using it to poison Tvlakv, his slave trader. A windspren in the form of a slender young woman only a handspan tall speaks to Kaladin and wants to know what the blackbane is. Kaladin is surprised that she knows his name. As they converse, he observes that she is much more intelligent than a typical spren. When she asks why he doesn't fight anymore, he says that he has failed. Kaladin sees Tvlakv going to inspect a sick slave. Kaladin tells him that the man has the grinding coughs and will survive if given extra water. Tvlakv removes the man from the rest of the slaves, and Kaladin thinks he is going to give him water. Instead, Bluth brutally murders the man. Kaladin is upset over his failure to save him. In his anger at the other slave's murder, he crushed the blackbane against the bars of the wagon, losing most of it.`, 7000, 'Kaladin'),
    new Chapter(3, `City of Bells`, `Shallan Davar has just arrived in Kharbranth, the City of Bells. She experiences a culture-shock, amazed at the number and variety of people in the city. After a short conversation with Captain Tozbek of the Wind's Pleasure, the boat she arrived on, she gets word that Jasnah Kholin, the woman she has been chasing for several months, is still in the city. Shallan and one of Captain Tozbek's sailors, Yalb, make the trip up to the palace so Shallan can speak to Jasnah. When they arrive, she asks Yalb to wait for her outside the palace. It is revealed that Shallan had requested to be Jasnah's ward, and that Jasnah told her to meet her in Dumadari. Shallan has been chasing her from city to city ever since. Shallan is very nervous as her house's finances are in ruins since the death of her father, and if she doesn't find some source of income or other means of controlling their rival political houses, her house won't last long. She also reveals that her request to be Jasnah's ward is somehow related to resolving her house's crisis, though she does not make clear how. The chapter ends with Shallan turning a corner and seeing Jasnah.`, 5500, 'Shallan'),
    new Chapter(4, `The Shattered Plains`, `Kaladin is sitting in the slave wagon, waiting for the caravan to stop for lunch and noting that it's well after the time the caravan usually stops. After a few minutes, he realizes that it is because Tvlakv is lost. Tvlakv remembers that Kaladin was once an Alethi soldier and might have knowledge of the lands. When he asks Kaladin to help them find the way out, Kaladin tears his map to pieces and tells Tvlakv that he doesn't know the way out. In the conversation that follows, Tvlakv says that he is only comfortable with the idea of Kaladin escaping because he knows that he wants revenge on Brightlord Amaram more than he does on Tvlakv. Kaladin realizes that if Tvlakv knows about Amaram, then he also knows that Kaladin isn't actually a deserter, in contrast to the official story given when he was sold. Tvlakv acknowledges this but says that it's the story they will stick to because men who are guilty of high crimes are difficult to sell at a good price. A short time later, the windspren comes back. She had apparently left during the recent highstorm, but now tells Kaladin that there is a large group of people not far away. A few minutes later, Kaladin realizes that it's an Alethi war camp, and that their destination is the Shattered Plains. The other slaves express hope that they will be treated fairly in the warcamps. Kaladin has his doubts, thinking of the many lighteyes who have proven to be corrupt in the past. His one remaining hope is that he will be allowed to fight again.`, 5800, 'Kaladin'),
    new Chapter(5, `Heretic`, `As Shallan meets Jasnah Kholin for the first time, she admires Jasnah as the ideal beauty â€“ tall, Alethi tan skin, long dark hair. She is talking to a man who Shallan later identifies as King Taravangian of Kharbranth. Jasnah and Taravangian seem to be negotiating over something, though Shallan can't tell what. As they begin to walk, Jasnah beckons for Shallan to follow. After a preliminary conversation, Jasnah mentions that because Shallan was so persistent in seeking her out, she will hear her petition to be her ward. Shallan is shocked, as she had believed that she had already been accepted as Jasnah's ward. A lengthy conversation about Shallan's level of education ensues, in which it is decided that Shallan has passing skill in most subjects, is very good in the sciences, excels at drawing and writing (the feminine arts), and is sadly lacking in history and philosophy. They arrive at the entrance to a room which has been blocked off by a large, fallen stone. Shallan realizes that the king's granddaughter is trapped in the room, and Jasnah is planning to use her Soulcaster to remove the stone in exchange for access to the Palanaeum. Jasnah Soulcasts the stone, transforming it into smoke. The king retrieves his granddaughter and, when asked, agrees to take Jasnah to the Palanaeum. Jasnah rejects Shallan as her ward because of her lack of education in history and philosophy. Shallan is frustrated, but decides to persevere. It is then that Shallan reveals that she wishes to become Jasnah's ward not out of scholarly pursuit, but in order to steal her Soulcaster to help her family's finances recover.`, 6200, 'Shallan'),
    new Chapter(5, `Bridge Four`, `Kaladin and the rest of the slave caravan have arrived at the Shattered Plains, specifically at the warcamp of Highprince Sadeas. They are taken to a woman who is to decide whether she can use any of the slaves or not. When Kaladin tries to convince her to let him fight, Tvlakv tells her that Kaladin is a deserter, dashing his hopes. The woman decides that Kaladin and his companions are to be made members of the bridge crews. Kaladin and his new immediate superior, Gaz, take an instant dislike to each other, and as a result, Kaladin is placed in one of the worst locations on the bridge when they are called on a bridge run, without the benefit of shoes or vest for protection. After several hours of agony carrying the bridge, they arrive at the chasm where the enemy Parshendi are waiting on the other side. They take volleys of arrows while placing their bridge. Kaladin is the only survivor in the front row. He wakes up hours later when the windspren who's been following him shocks him with some sort of energy. Kaladin realizes that if he doesn't hurry, he will be left behind. The spren tells him that her name is Sylphrena, or Syl. Though he is exhausted, Kaladin takes a spot on the bridge and begins the long way back to camp.`, 5400, 'Kaladin'),
    new Chapter(7, `Anything Reasonable`, `Shallan is en route to the Palanaeum, hoping to convince Jasnah that she is worthy to be her ward. She believes that it is critical that she find a way to do so, as without her father, her family can no longer Soulcast its way into wealth or manipulate others into doing as they want. She is allowed to wait for Jasnah in her reading alcove, though she is denied access to the Palanaeum itself. While she waits, she sketches several Memories from the past few hours, then writes a letter to Jasnah containing arguments for her reconsideration. She is interrupted by an ardent introducing himself as Kabsal. He asks to wait for Jasnah with Shallan and praises her sketches highly. Kabsal tells Shallan that he is trying to convert Jasnah, an avowed atheist, to Vorinism. He leaves, asking her to let Jasnah know that he had come by to speak with her. She agrees, and begins to lacquer her drawings. She realizes that she's been there for quite a while and begins to gather her things, leaving the letter for Jasnah. Before she can leave, however, Jasnah appears in the doorway, looking displeased.`, 7500, 'Shallan'),
    new Chapter(8, `Nearer the Flame`, `Jasnah scolds Shallan, telling her that she had already made her decision. Shallan is embarrassed that she disturbed Jasnah again and leaves. After only a few moments, however, Jasnah calls her back and apologizes to her and gives her Shallan's money pouch that she had left behind. Shallan asks Jasnah to read the letter she had written for her earlier. Jasnah is impressed that she is self-taught and agrees to accept Shallan as her ward once she has adequately learned philosophy and history. Shallan is pleased by this, but worries that she cannot learn fast enough to save her house. Shallan leaves the Conclave and meets up with Yalb, who has been gambling with some guards. Yalb insists that she is talented enough to be accepted if she would just be more persistent, so she decides to buy a bunch of books on history and philosophy and return to start studying right away, planning to impress Jasnah with her rapid learning just before Jasnah leaves Kharbranth. Before long, however, she is interrupted by Jasnah, who had paid the servants to tell her if Shallan returned to the Palanaeum. Jasnah asks to see Shallan's satchel. When she comes across Shallan's sketches with notes on biology, she asks why she made them, to which Shallan replies that she wanted to. It is ultimately the fact that Shallan pursues scholarship in her free time, along with her persistence, that convince Jasnah to accept her as her ward. Shallan reflects that now she's completed the first phase of her plan, but now needs to discover how to accomplish the rest of it without being caught.`, 5000, 'Shallan')

Lady Aving Cett appears on the balcony, urging Wax to rejoin the party. Instead, Wax slips off the balcony and drops a bullet casing to Push himself over the garden wall.

Making his way to the sitting room expecting to find Lord Harms and his daughter, Wax instead encounters his old friend and partner Wayne. As they discuss where Wayne should be--in Weathering, not Wax's sitting room--the door chimes again and Wax attempts to usher Wayne from the room; Wayne in his Roughs attire would give the wrong impression. Unable to get him from the room before Lord Harms barges in, Wax prepares to introduce Wayne as an old friend when Wayne, having put on a disguise, proclaims to be Wax's uncle. Lord Harms introduces his daughter and her cousin, Marasi. While Wayne and Lord Harms exchange small talk, Steris aims to get to the point of the meeting.

During the meeting, Wayne erects a speed bubble and hands Wax a bullet that Wax later discovers is made from aluminum.

When one reaches Wax's table, he hides Marasi's notebook and Wayne's dueling canes against the table with a gentle Push to hold them. The apparent leader searches, comparing the drawings in his hand with the people at each table, confirming Wax and Wayne's suspicion about the kidnappings: the theft is a ruse to allay suspicion.

Wax shows off more of his fanciful expertise with his powers and comes to a startling realization on the identity of the Vanishers' leader. Wax goes after Tarson to rescue Marasi. Tarson holds Marasi hostage similar to how Bloody Tan held Lessie, making Wax freeze again. Only thanks to Marasi stunning Tarson is he able to bring his gun up, wounding the thug in the arm. Wax and Wayne, with a little help from Marasi wielding a rifle, dispatch the majority of the bandits, only to allow the leader to escape with Steris right before the constabulary shows up. Constable Brettin berates Wax for causing havoc, and Reddi gives him the casualty report, which indicates that only Lord Peterus was among the civilian deaths. Brettin is still displeased with Wax's stunt, which draws the two into a quiet argument. Wayne steals one of the aluminum guns the bandits were using from the evidence pile and gives it to Wax.`, 5500, 'Marasi'),
    new Chapter(7, 'Seven', `Marasi decides to visit Wax at his mansion, where he is engaged with metallurgy, trying to discover the exact alloy used in the aluminum gun. Marasi informs Wax that Lord Harms is willing to bankroll Wax in his endeavor to rescue Steris. The two of them attempt to reason out the motives of the Vanishers and their operation and come to the conclusion that the women who were taken hostage by the Vanishers were taken for the purpose of breeding Allomancers. Meanwhile, Wax sends Wayne to investigate the Vanishers who were arrested.`, 6000, 'Wayne'),
    new Chapter(8, 'Eight', `Wayne strides into the Fourth Octant constabulary offices disguised as a Seventh Octant Captain, seeking Captain Brettin. Wayne--Captain Guffon Trenchant--convinces Brettin to grant him interviews with some of the Vanishers. With Brettin overseeing from the door, Wayne alternates between playing a constable and whispering in street accents, hoping to convince the detainees to give up the information he seeks on the Vanishers. He manages to glean some information from the two he interrogates and leaves with Brettin none the wiser.`, 6700, 'Wax'),
    new Chapter(9, 'Nine', `Waxillium and Marasi are debating philosophy, and Wax's past is brought up again, as well as Marasi's education. Wayne returns with the information he gained from the constabulary. Tillaume makes tea for Wax which Wayne procures for himself in order to take more bendalloy. Wax accidentally insults Marasi and Wayne discovers the tea has been poisoned. Tillaume attempts to assassinate Wax with a gun, but Wax injures the butler instead. Concern for Wayne causes Wax to miss Tillaume triggering the bomb in the basket he'd brought with him. Wayne, having recovered a little thanks to his Feruchemical ability throws up a speed bubble just as the basket explodes. Wax then taps the weight he had Feruchemically stored, breaking the floor and causing them to fall through to the room below, though Wayne is badly burnt on the back from the explosion. Presumed dead, they use the cover as an opportunity to go after the Vanishers.`, 5100, 'Marasi')
